              <p id="paragraph1">
                Natural farming is a unique method of agriculture that is completely different from conventional
                agriculture.
                Conventional agriculture follows the system of monoculture (one crop in a field) but natural farming
                follows polyculture (biodiversity-based agriculture).
                Conventional agriculture is input-based agriculture but natural farming is knowledge-based
                agriculture.
                Conventional agriculture is a loss-making business for the farmers so governments have to provide huge
                subsidies to make it viable whereas natural farming is a highly profitable business for the farmers
                and entrepreneurs.
                A natural farming agroecosystem looks like a natural forest and it functions like a natural ecosystem.
                Natural farming depends on the conservation of natural resources and restoration of ecosystem services
                to maximize crop production and crop protection.
                The idea of natural farming originally came from the traditional agricultural knowledge of the
                indigenous people.
                Modern farmers have refined that knowledge to design various nature-based agriculture forms Here we
                summarised the basic principles of natural farming in a precise manner to clear all doubts and for a
                clear understanding of the common people.
                The adoption of natural farming is not only important for the profit maximization of the farmers but
                also important for the conservation of soil health, plant health, animal health, human health, and
                environmental health for future generations.
                Natural farming can be practiced in a small-scale urban terrace garden for home consumption of healthy
                vegetables and fruits or can be adopted in large-scale corporate farming for earning high ROI and
                carbon credit.

              <p id="paragraph2">To understand natural farming the definition of agriculture should be wider.
                Agriculture should be defined as domestication, breeding, and culture of plants, animals, and
                microorganisms,
                in open fields or closed environments, for the production of food, feed, medicine, fibre, and other
                materials of economic value for the benefit of man.
                Agricultural systems can vary widely, here we divided them into two basic types:
                monoculture (anti-biodiversity agriculture) and polyculture (biodiversity-based agriculture).</p>

              <p id="paragraph3">Growing a single crop in a field is known as monoculture. Monoculture is unnatural and completely
                anti-biodiversity agriculture because it continuously fights with nature using chemical poisons to
                keep biodiversity away from the crop plants.
                Monoculture applies herbicides to kill weeds (plant biodiversity), applies insecticides or pesticides
                to kill insect pests, predators, and parasites (animal biodiversity) and applies fungicides to kill
                both harmful (pathogen) and beneficial fungi
                (mycorrhiza and antagonists), and applies antibiotics to kill both harmful and beneficial bacteria
                (microorganism biodiversity).
                Monoculture applies deep tillage to destroy soil structure, soil water holding capacity, soil organic
                matter, soil microorganism biodiversity,
                and soil health. Monoculture disrupts natural biogeochemical cycles in soil such as the water cycle,
                carbon cycle, nitrogen cycle, phosphorus cycle, and potassium cycle
                to make the soil dead and to make the crop plant completely dependent on the supply of external inputs
                (seeds, fertilisers, micronutrients, growth regulators and pesticides) for crop production and crop
                protection. Monoculture is therefore unsustainable in nature and it is a loss-making business for the
                farmer. Monoculture has many side effects such as deforestation,
                habitat loss, habitat fragmentation, biodiversity loss, extinction of species, loss of underground
                water, eutrophication, soil erosion, soil degradation, desertification of land, genetic erosion,
                emission of greenhouse gases, climate change,
                an outbreak of insect pests, diseases, and weeds, environmental pollution, food waste, obesity,
                food-related diseases, hunger, malnutrition, poverty, farmers indebtedness, cancer of the farmer and
                farmers suicide. Monoculture can be subdivided into four different types based on
                the inputs used. (1) Conventional agriculture - conventional agriculture uses synthetic chemical
                inputs. (2) Organic farming - organic farming uses organic and biological inputs such as compost,
                vermicompost, biofertilizers, sludge, green manures, crop rotation, intercropping, inorganic
                fertilizers, growth regulators,
                botanical pesticides, biopesticides, light traps, pheromone traps, yellow sticky traps. (3) integrated
                nutrient management (INM), integrated pest management (IPM), and integrated disease management (IDM) -
                INM, IPM, and IDM use both chemical and organic inputs. (4) Integrated farming - integrated farming
                integrates monoculture
                crops with animal husbandry or fishery to increase productivity.

              <h2></h2>
              <p id="paragraph4">Natural farming or polyculture or nature-based agriculture or biodiversity-based
                agriculture is
                nothing but the modernization of the traditional system of agriculture. Modern polyculture systems are
                known by different names such as Agroecology, Agroecological Symbiosis, Agroforestry, Analog Forestry,
                Conservation Agriculture, Ecological Farming, Fertility Farming, Food Forest, Forest Farming, Forest
                Gardening, Korean Natural Farming (KNF), Natueco Farming, Natural Farming, No-till Farming,
                Permaculture,
                Probiotic Farming, Regenerative Agriculture, Rewilding Agriculture, Sorjan Farming System, Sustainable
                Intensification, Syntropic Agriculture, Taungya Cultivation, Vedic Agriculture (Rishi Kheti) and Zero
                Budget Natural Farming (ZBNF). Out of these names, we used "natural farming" as the generic name for
                polyculture because it is easily understandable to all. Polyculture means growing more than two crops
                at a time in the same field (mixed cropping). A natural farming agroecosystem looks like a natural
                forest and it
                functions like a forest ecosystem. Natural farming conserves natural resources (natural capital)
                and restores the natural ecosystem services to minimize the cost of production and maximize crop
                production, crop protection,
                and profit of the farmer. Natural farming is a source of a rich nutritional diet and a regular source
                of passive income for the farmer daily.</p>

              <p id="paragraph7">Though natural farming agroecosystems are highly complex systems, the methods of natural farming are
                very simple and effective.
                These methods were originally invented by the indigenous people, thousands of years ago, out of their
                own experience and deep understanding of nature and natural phenomena.
                Since the 1970s, many modern farmers all over the world have experimented with these traditional
                methods and developed new systems of agriculture, as an alternative solution to the unsustainable
                chemical input-based agriculture (monoculture).
                These varied systems of biodiversity-based agriculture (polyculture) have some common basic
                principles. These methods can be combined to form a complete package of practices for successful

              <p id="paragraph8">Profit maximization of the farmer

                Natural farming is a normal business of the farmer for earning their livelihood therefore, the
                ultimate goal of natural farming is their profit maximisation.
                The factors that contribute to the profit maximisation of farmers are (1) minimum risk - agriculture
                is practised in the open field therefore it faces different kinds of risks such as climate risk (low
                or high temperature, low or high rainfall, high wind, hailstorm, lightning), biotic risk (outbreak of
                insect pests, diseases, weeds and wild animals) and market risk (low demand, over supply, low price).
                Crop diversification in polyculture can reduce risk and increase returns in agriculture.
                (2) Minimum cost of production - natural farming completely depends on natural capital and ecosystem
                services for crop production and crop protection. The farmers need not purchase any input from the
                market, hire any machine or labour for carrying out natural farming, which saves huge cost,
                (3) maximum crop yield - the aggregate crop production per year is highest in natural farming.
                Application of advanced methods such as selection of the best varieties, optimization of crop
                portfolio, and optimization of landscape design to maximise the leaf area index can maximise the
                aggregate crop yield,
                (4) maximum product diversity - maximum crop diversity, farm animal diversity and aquatic animal
                diversity effectively make natural farming agroecosystem an agricultural supermarket with diversified
                product range.
                (5) maximum product quality - natural farming produces premium quality products through breeding of
                exclusive and exquisite plant varieties, breeding exclusive animal breeds, selection of the best plant
                varieties, selection of off-season or all-season varieties, elimination of chemical fertilisers,
                growth regulators, pesticides and chemical fruit ripeners and biotic pollination of crops by native
                pollinator
                biodiversity,
                (6) maximum price of crops - direct marketing of crops gives complete liberty to the farmers to fix
                the price of their own crops and they tend to fix a premium price for their premium products,
                (7) regular cash flow - crop diversification and use of off-season or all-season varieties help mixed
                harvesting of multiple crops on a daily basis, generating daily cash flow and passive income for the
                farmer,
                (8) Law of increasing marginal returns - the income from the natural farming agroecosystems gradually
                increase over time but the cost of production gradually decreases over time. As a result, income and
                profit increase steadily.
                (9) Sustainability of profit margin - continuous improvement of soil health, plant health, animal
                health, human health and agroecosystem health increase sustainability in natural farming
                agroecosystem.
                (10) Resilience of the agroecosystem - natural farming depends on biodiversity because biodiversity
                imparts resilience against abiotic, biotic and financial risks in agriculture.

              <p>Globally, organic farming is regulated by IFOAM. Organic farming is a system of monoculture that
                follows conservation tillage, organic seed, crop rotation and avoids use of synthetic chemical inputs
                as far as possible. IFOAM has a positive and negative list of inputs that should be used or avoided in
                organic farming. IFOAM regulates a system of organic certification to differentiate organic products
                from chemical products. The cost of organic farming is higher than conventional agriculture but the
                quality of organic products are inferior to conventional agricultural products. Therefore the price of
                organic products is higher and consumer acceptance of organic products is limited.
                On the other hand, natural farming is a spontaneous initiative of the farmers for minimising cost and
                maximising profit in farming. It is a system of polyculture that totally depends on available natural
                resources (soil, water, sunlight, temperature), natural ecosystem services (biogeochemical cycles) and
                native biodiversity of plants, animals and microorganisms, to maximise crop diversification, crop
                yield and profit. The risk and cost of natural farming is minimum but the yield, quality and market
                price of the products are maximum. Actually consumers regularly visit the natural farms to buy natural
                food products. Consumers judge the quality of the naturally grown product by its taste, and there is
                no need for any third party certification.

              <p>Plant, animal and microorganism biodiversity maintain the soil tilth in the natural farming
                agroecosystem.
                Plant roots penetrate the soil layers and incorporate organic matter in soil after dying and decaying.
                Earthworms, insects and other animals bore in the soil and bring bottom soil to the top. These tunnels
                help aeration and infiltration of rainwater in soil. Earthworms shred and decompose organic matter and
                mix it with soil. Earthworm casting (vermicompost) contains bacteria that mineralise organic matter
                and help increase organic carbon in soil. Bacterial mass forms biofilm over the soil particles and
                helps soil aggregation and increase water holding capacity of soil. In this way earthworms help
                tilling of soil most efficiently, without disturbing the soil structure, soil water, soil organic
                matter, soil biodiversity and soil health.
                Therefore mechanical tillage is unnecessary and harmful for natural farming.</p>

              <p>Water cycle naturally occurs through the atmosphere (air) and geosphere (soil and water bodies).
                Natural farming tries to create a rainforest by planting a biodiversity of plant species that
                regulates this water cycle.
                The plant leaves release water vapour through transpiration and emit biogenic volatile organic
                compounds (BVOC) and ice-nucleating bacteria (such as Pseudomonas putida) in the air during air
                turbulence.
                In this way plants induce cloud seeding and induce rainfall. Plants can absorb the shock of the
                falling rain drops and can harvest rainwater through leaves, stems and roots. The mulching layer over
                the soil surface absorbs rainwater, checks runoff and helps slow infiltration of water down the soil
                layers to reach the underground water aquifers.
                Mulching layers also check the water loss from soil through evapotranspiration. Overall, the natural
                farming agroecosystem maintains soil water level constantly at field capacity throughout the year for
                optimum plant growth and development. Therefore, there is no need for irrigation in the natural
                farming agroecosystem. </p>

              <p>Biological control is a human intervention in natural ecosystem services. Introduction, augmentation
                and conservation of specific alien invasive species of insects or
                microorganisms in the field, to control specific insect pests, diseases or weeds, is known as
                biological control. As the introduced alien invasive species never survived in the non-native
                environments, biological control remained unsuccessful in the field. Moreover, biological control is
                an expensive proposition.
                On the other hand, natural control is ubiquitous in nature, it needs no human intervention. Man
                creates the natural farming agroecosystem by mimicking the structure of the natural forest ecosystems,
                to restore natural control on biodiversity.

                Natural farming agroecosystems maximise leaf area index (LAI), solar energy harvesting, rainwater
                harvesting and carbon capture, to maximise its biomass synthesis.
                Natural farming regulates temperature cycle, water cycle, carbon cycle, nitrogen cycle, phosphorus
                cycle and potash cycle to maximise crop nutrition, crop yield.
                Natural farming passively regulates natural control to maximise crop protection against pests,
                diseases and weeds. Mixed harvesting of multiple crops ensures good market price of crops for farmers
                and ensures nutritional security of the consumer.
                Advanced methods of natural farming such as breeding of exclusive and exquisite plant varieties and
                animal breeds, multilayer polycropping, netting and bagging of fruits, direct marketing of farm
                products and eco-agritourism can maximise crop yield, crop quality and market price of crops.
                In this way natural farming not only ensures food security but also nutritional security of the world.
